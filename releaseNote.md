1.1.0
-----
+ Added another database access programming style: dynamic SQL composition. This new style allows developers to build SQL query templates in node.js modules without having to create XML files as the older style would require. The programmatically created SQL query templates are parameterized and can be reused just like the other style can do. With the new programming style, it gives developers more flexbilities.

1.0.1
-----
+ Added support for multiple database access.
+ Command line tools such as 'genAll.js' and 'genView.js' can still work on a single database.

1.0.0
-----
+ Officially released
